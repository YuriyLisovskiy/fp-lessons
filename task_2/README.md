## IO monad task:
 * [IO monad implementation](monad/io.py)
 * [solved task](io_task.py)
 
[Question](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises.txt#L40):

Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a
single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

`8`

Then, the output should be:

`40320`

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
assumed to be a console input.

Imperative solution:

```python
def fact(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    return x * fact(x - 1)


x = int(input())
print(fact(x))
```

## Maybe monad task:

[Question](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises.txt#L1836):

Please write a binary search function which searches an item in a
sorted list. The function should return the index of element to be
searched in the list.

Hints: use if/elif to deal with conditions.

Solution:
```python
import math


def bin_search(li, element):
    bottom = 0
    top = len(li) - 1
    index = -1
    while top >= bottom and index == -1:
        mid = int(math.floor((top + bottom) / 2.0))
        if li[mid] == element:
            index = mid
        elif li[mid] > element:
            top = mid - 1
        else:
            bottom = mid + 1
    return index


li = [2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 222]
print(bin_search(li, 11))
print(bin_search(li, 12))
```
